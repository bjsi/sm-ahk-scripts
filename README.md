# SuperMemo AHK scripts

Some AHK scripts I wrote for automating certain SuperMemo UI tasks.

I haven't assigned hotkeys to any of these scripts because I prefer to run them via an application launcher called [UELI](https://ueli.app/#/).

Here's an explanation of how to set up UELI to run these AHK scripts:

- Clone this repo with git
- Download [UELI](https://ueli.app/#/)
- Right click on the UELI icon in your taskbar and click on settings.
- I personally disable all of the plugins except for Application Search because I only use UELI to lauch SuperMemo AHK scripts, but you can pick and choose.
- In the Application Search settings, click add application folder and enter the path to this cloned repository.
- In the application file extensions add .ahk.
- Press Alt+Space to activate the key launcher.
- Type in the name of a script and press enter to run it.

If you want to see these scripts in action, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1-sHbgJpqc) where I use some of the scripts to set and link concepts.
